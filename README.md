# magic-cloak-computervision
An Invisibility Cloak project built using Python and OpenCV that makes objects disappear in real-time video streams. By detecting a specific color (red cloak) through color segmentation, the cloak is replaced with the background, creating a magical "invisible" effect â€” just like in the movies! ðŸŽ¥âœ¨
